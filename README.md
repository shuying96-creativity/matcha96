# I am currently a student learning how to code.
At the same time, I have minimal knowledge about it.
Will be learning all the way for 4 years,
And I hope to master even better!

# My goal is to:
- Master the HTML, CSS for web development
- Master basic python for school
- aiming for internship to achieve the milestone.
